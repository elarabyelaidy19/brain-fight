Consider integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 written down along the circle in such a way that the distance between any two neighboring numbers is equal (note that 0 and n - 1 are neighboring, too).

Given n and firstNumber, find the number which is written in the radially opposite position to firstNumber.

Example

For n = 10 and firstNumber = 2, the output should be
circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) = 7.

=end 

def circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber)
  pair = 0
  pair = (firstNumber + ((n / 2))).abs 
  if pair > n  
      pair = (firstNumber - ((n / 2))).abs  
  end 
  return (n-n) if pair > n - 1 
  pair 
end

# second  

def circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) 

  (firstNumber + (n / 2)) % n 
end 


# Third 

def circleOfNumbers(n, first_number) 
  result = n / 2 + first_number 
  result < n ? result : result - n

You have deposited a specific amount of money into your bank account. Each year your balance increases at the same growth rate. With the assumption that you don't make any additional deposits, find out how long it would take for your balance to pass a specific threshold.

Example

For deposit = 100, rate = 20, and threshold = 170, the output should be
depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold) = 3.

Each year the amount of money in your account increases by 20%. So throughout the years, your balance would be:

year 0: 100;
year 1: 120;
year 2: 144;
year 3: 172.8.
Thus, it will take 3 years for your balance to pass the threshold, so the answer is 3.
=end 


def depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold)
  years = 0 
  rate = rate / 100.to_f 
  
  while threshold > deposit 
      years += 1 
      deposit += deposit * rate  # == deposite *= (1 + rate)
  end 
  years
end 


# formula  
# deposit + (deposite * rate)^y = balance after y Year 

def  
  
def depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold)
  num = Math.log(threshold.to_f / deposit) 
  dem = Math.log(1 + (rate / 100.to_f)) 

  return (num / dem).ceil

Caring for a plant can be hard work, but since you tend to it regularly, you have a plant that grows consistently. Each day, its height increases by a fixed amount represented by the integer upSpeed. But due to lack of sunlight, the plant decreases in height every night, by an amount represented by downSpeed.

Since you grew the plant from a seed, it started at height 0 initially. Given an integer desiredHeight, your task is to find how many days it'll take for the plant to reach this height.

Example

For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10, and desiredHeight = 910, the output should be
growingPlant(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight) = 10.

=end 

# one 
def growingPlant(up, down, desiredHeight)

  while desiredHeight > decrease

    days += 1 
  end 
  days 
end 

def growingPlant(up, down, desiredHeight) 
  days = 0 
  decrease = 0 

  while desiredHeight > decrease 
    decrease += up     
    days += 1 
    return days if decrease >= desiredHeight 
    decrease -= down
  end 
  days

def growingPlant(up, down, desiredHeight) 
  return 1 if up > desiredHeight

# apple boxes You have k apple boxes full of apples. Each square box of size m contains m Ã— m apples. 
You just noticed two interesting properties about the boxes:

The smallest box is size 1, the next one is size 2,..., all the way up to size k.
Boxes that have an odd size contain only yellow apples. Boxes that have an even size contain only red apples.
Your task is to calculate the difference between the number of red apples and the number of yellow apples.

We want to turn the given integer into a number that has only one non-zero digit using a tail rounding approach. 
This means that at each step we take the last non 0 digit of the number and round it to 0 or to 10. 
If it's less than 5 we round it to 0 if it's larger than or equal to 5 we round it to 10 
(rounding to 10 means increasing the next significant digit by 1). 
The process stops immediately once there is only one non-zero digit lef 
1445 -> 1450 -> 1500 -> 2000. 
1234 -> 1230 -> 1200 -> 1000.

Imagine a white rectangular grid of n rows and m columns divided into two parts by a diagonal 
line running from the upper left to the lower right corner. Now let's paint the grid in two colors according to the following rules:

A cell is painted black if it has at least one point in common with the diagonal;
Otherwise, a cell is painted white.
Count the number of cells painted black.

Example

For n = 3 and m = 4, the output should be
solution(n, m) = 6.

There are 6 cells that have at least one common point with the diagonal and therefore are painted black.
=end 


def count_black_cell(n, m)
