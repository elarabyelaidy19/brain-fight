# Given an array of integers, find the maximal absolute difference between any two of its adjacent elements.

## Example
# For inputArray = [2, 4, 1, 0], the output should be
# arrayMaximalAdjacentDifference(inputArray) = 3.# 

def arrayMaximalAdjacentDifference(array) 
  array.each_cons(2).map { |a, b| (a - b).abs }.max 
end

def arrayMaximalAdjacentDifference(array) 
  max = 0 

  for i in (1...array.length) 
    diff = array[i] - array[i-1] 
    diff = diff.abs 
    max = diff if diff > max 
  end
